# FarmMD
A platform for farmers to check the health of their crops. Predict crop diseases using Deep Learning and provide solutions.

## How It Works
Farmers can take a picture of their diseased crop via our Mobile App or upload the image to our Website. Our CNN classifier that's trained to recognize various crop diseases then predicts the probability that the crop is infected and also gives out the disease type, if any. The mobile app ships with the CNN model, thus farmers do not need to connect to the internet to gain insight into their crop's health. This is especially useful for farmers living in remote regions, with poor internet connectivity.
However, having an internet connection allows one to access a plethora of additional features as follows
- Information regarding crop diseases in the vicinity presented in the form of a heatmap
- Subscribe to notifications indicating when a diseased crop is detected in the user's vicinity
- Additional weather information such as humidity, temperature and pressure at the time of classification
- Website includes a marketplace for farm products such as fertilizers, manure etc.
- Connect farmers to plant health practitioners for consultations
